# ðŸ““ Triple Enrichment Bait Design

## ðŸ§¬ðŸ§¬ðŸ§¬ Background 

In this repository are the bait files as part of the triple enrichment workflow

The objectives of the triple enrichment worklow is to:
1. Increase the sensitivity and specificity of probe-based pre-sequencing enrichment 
2. Generate contextualized metagenomic sequence data with real-time enrichment of antimicrobial resistance genes
3. Evaluate the performance of triple-enrichment using samples with diverse antimicrobial resistance gene composition.
